    "Predictions should be made at the household level only, but data for each of the three countries is provided at the household and individual level. It may be the case that you can construct additional features for the household using the individual data that are particular useful for predicting at the household level, which is why we provide both. There are six training files in total.\n",

Many of the multiple choice questions are about consumable goods--for example does your household have items such as Bar soap, Cooking oil, Matches, and Salt. Numeric questions often ask things like How many working cell phones in total does your household own? or How many separate rooms do the members of your household occupy?\n",
